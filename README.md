## Instructions

The memory game is a simple card matching game. The player selects 2 cards and attempts to match the symbols to fill the board.
The player is tracked both with a timer and a star rating (dependant on how many attemps it takes).
The game can be reset manually by the player or is reset automatically when the game is won.
